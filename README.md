# Network packet sniffer And Analyzer

A packet sniffer — also known as a packet analyzer, protocol analyzer or network analyzer — is a piece of hardware or software used to monitor network traffic. Sniffers work by examining streams of data packets that flow between computers on a network as well as between networked computers and the larger Internet. These packets are intended for — and addressed to — specific machines, but using a packet sniffer in "promiscuous mode" allows IT professionals, end users or malicious intruders to examine any packet, regardless of destination. It's possible to configure sniffers in two ways. The first is "unfiltered," meaning they will capture all packets possible and write them to a local hard drive for later examination. Next is "filtered" mode, meaning analyzers will only capture packets that contain specific data elements.
